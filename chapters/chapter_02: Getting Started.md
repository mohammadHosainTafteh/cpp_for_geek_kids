# chapter 02: Getting Started

## 2.1 Define Your First Project

### 2.1.1 What is a “Hello, Geek!” program?

A “Hello, Geek!” program is your very first step into the world of coding. It’s a simple C++ program that prints a message to the screen — usually something like `Hello, Geek!` — and helps you understand how code turns into action. This tiny project teaches you how to:

* Write a basic C++ program

* Save and compile your code

* Run your program and see the output

Even though it’s small, this program introduces key ideas: structure, syntax, and the power of the compiler. It’s also a great way to test your setup and make sure everything — from your operating system to your editor and compiler — is working correctly.

Think of it as your geeky handshake with the computer. You write the code, the computer responds, and the adventure begins.

### 2.1.2 Why Start with a Simple Project?

Starting with a simple project like "Hello, Geek!" is the perfect way to begin your coding journey. It’s small, quick, and gives you a full tour of the tools you’ll be using throughout Chapter 1. You’ll write code, compile it, run it, and see the result — all in one sitting.

Here’s why it works:

* It helps you focus on learning the tools: Ubuntu, VS Code, g++, and GitHub.

* It builds confidence by showing you that you can write and run real code.

* It introduces the basic workflow: write → save → compile → run.

* It sets the stage for deeper learning in later sections.

By starting simple, you avoid getting overwhelmed. You’ll understand how each part of your setup works and how they connect. Once you’ve completed this project, you’ll be ready to explore the rest of Chapter 1 — installing build tools, setting up VS Code, writing in different editors, and even using AI to generate your own programs.

### 2.1.3 How to Search and Identify What Tools You Need to Solve It

Before you start building your first project, you need to know what tools are required — and how to find them. This section helps you think like a geeky problem-solver and researcher.

Let’s say your goal is to write and run a simple C++ program. What tools do you need?

* **Operating System** — Ubuntu is recommended for its simplicity and power.

* **Text Editor** — nano, gedit, or VS Code.

* **Compiler** — g++ is the standard C++ compiler.

* **Terminal** — to run commands and compile code.

* **Version Control** — Git and GitHub help you save and share your work.

You don’t need to memorize these tools — you just need to learn how to search for them. Try asking questions like:

* "How do I install g++ on Ubuntu?"

* "What’s the best C++ editor for beginners?"

* "How do I run C++ code in VS Code?"

* "What is GitHub and how do I use it?"

Learning to search is a superpower. It helps you find answers, discover new tools, and solve problems on your own. In the rest of Chapter 1, you’ll install each tool step-by-step, write your first program, and even use AI to generate code. But first, get comfortable with asking questions and exploring answers — that’s how real geeks learn.

## 2.2 Choosing Your Operating System
