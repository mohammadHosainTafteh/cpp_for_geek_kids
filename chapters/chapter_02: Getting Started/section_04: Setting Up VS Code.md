## 2.4 Setting Up VS Code

### 2.4.1 Exploring Code Editors: From CLI to Full IDE

Before diving into VS Code, it's helpful to understand the landscape of code editors. This section introduces different types of editors so geek kids can appreciate the flexibility of coding environments.

#### CLI Editors (Terminal-based):

* `nano`: A simple, beginner-friendly editor that works directly in the terminal.

* `micro`: A modern CLI editor with intuitive shortcuts and syntax highlighting.

* `vim`: A powerful editor with a steep learning curve, ideal for advanced users.

* `newvim`: A modern fork of Vim with better defaults, built-in plugin manager, and smoother onboarding for beginners.

#### GUI Simple Editors:

* `gedit`: Lightweight and pre-installed on Ubuntu, great for quick edits.

* `Kate`: A KDE-based editor with tabs, syntax highlighting, and session management.

#### Full IDEs:

* VS Code: Lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform. Ideal for beginners and pros alike.

* Qt Creator: Excellent for GUI-based C++ development.

* CLion: A commercial IDE with deep C++ support and smart code analysis.

**Geek Tip**: Try editing the same file in `nano`, `gedit`, and VS Code to feel the difference in workflow.

### 2.4.2 Why VS Code Is Perfect for Geek Kids

VS Code is the recommended editor for this book because it balances simplicity with power. Here's why it's a great choice:

* Free and open-source

* Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

* Rich extension ecosystem for every language and tool

* Built-in terminal, Git integration, and debugging tools

* Easy to customize with themes and settings

* Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Codespaces ‚Äî a cloud-based version of VS Code you can run entirely in your browser

### 2.4.3 Installing VS Code on Ubuntu

There are several ways to install VS Code on Ubuntu. Here's the easiest method:

#### Option 1: Ubuntu Software Center

* Search for "Visual Studio Code" and click install.

#### Option 2: Terminal (Recommended)

  ```
  sudo snap install code --classic
  ```

#### Option 3: Download from Official Website

* Visit [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the `.deb` package. Once downloaded, you can install it using the terminal:
  ```
  sudo apt install ./code_*.deb
  ```
* Make sure you're in the directory where the `.deb` file was saved. You can use `cd ~/Downloads` if you downloaded it to your default folder. This command will install VS Code and handle dependencies automatically.

**Geek Tip**: Use `code --version` to verify installation and check which version of VS Code is installed ‚Äî this works whether you installed it via Snap, apt, or a .deb package.

### 2.4.4 Setting Up C++ Extensions

To turn VS Code into a C++ development powerhouse, install the right extensions and configure build tasks.

* **Install C/C++ Extension Pack** by Microsoft

2.4.6 GitHub Copilot: Your AI Coding Assistant

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you write code faster and smarter. It works right inside VS Code, suggesting entire lines or blocks of code as you type.

üß† What Is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is trained on billions of lines of code and can:

Suggest code completions based on your comments and context

Help you write functions, loops, and even entire programs

Offer alternative solutions or fix bugs

Translate natural language into working code



‚öôÔ∏è How to Install GitHub Copilot in VS Code

Open VS Code and go to the Extensions panel (Ctrl + Shift + X).

Search for GitHub Copilot.

Click Install.

Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted. If you don‚Äôt have a GitHub account yet, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôll learn all about GitHub in the next chapters. You can activate GitHub Copilot later once you're ready.

Accept permissions and restart VS Code if needed.



üöÄ Benefits of Using GitHub Copilot

Helps you learn by example ‚Äî see how code is written

Speeds up repetitive tasks like loops and conditionals

Encourages exploration and creativity

Reduces frustration when you're stuck
